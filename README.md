## Homework 4 (20 Points)

The deadline for Homework 4 is Wednesday, Oct 5, 10pm. The late
submission deadline is Tuesday, Oct 11, 10pm.

### Getting the code template

Before you perform the next steps, you first need to create your own
private copy of this git repository. To do so, click on the link
provided in the announcement of this homework assignment on
Piazza. After clicking on the link, you will receive an email from
GitHub, when your copy of the repository is ready. It will be
available at
`https://github.com/nyu-pl-fa22/hw04-<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>`.  
Note that this may take a few minutes.

* Open a browser at `https://github.com/nyu-pl-fa22/hw04-<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>` with your Github username inserted at the appropriate place in the URL.
* Choose a place on your computer for your homework assignments to reside and open a terminal to that location.
* Execute the following git command: <br/>
  ```git clone https://github.com/nyu-pl-fa22/hw04-<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.git```<br/>
  ```cd hw04```

Put your answers to problems 1-3 into the text file `solution.md`.
The code template for solving Problem 4 is provided in the file

```
src/main/scala/pl/hw04/hw04.scala
```

relative to the root directory of the repository. Follow the
instructions in the notes for setting up your Scala toolchain to
import the project into InteliJ (or use your other favorite IDE or
editor to work on the assignment).


## Submitting your solution

Once you have completed the assignment, you can submit your solution
by pushing the modified files to GitHub. This can be done by
opening a terminal in the project's root directory and executing the
following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "solution"
git push
```

You can replace "solution" by a more meaningful commit message.

Refresh your browser window pointing at
```
https://github.com/nyu-pl-fa22/hw04-<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/
```
and double-check that your solution has been uploaded correctly.

You can resubmit an updated solution anytime by reexecuting the above
git commands. Though, please remember the rules for submitting
solutions after the homework deadline has passed.


### Problem 1: Activation Records (4 Points)

Consider the following C code excerpt from a university system that
allows users to query the system for grade entries in a student's
grade transcript:

```c
external int get_transcript_size(int student_id);
external void load_transcript(int student_id, char* grades, int size);
external int read_int();

char get_transcript_entry(int student_id, int entry) {
  int size = get_transcript_size(student_id);
  char grades[size];
  load_transcript(student_id, grades, size);
  return grades[entry];
}

int main() {
  int student_id = 42; // not to be revealed to the user
  int entry = read_int();
  char grade = get_transcript_entry(student_id, entry);
  printf("Requested grade: %c\n", grade);

  return 0;
}
```

The code assumes three functions for which we only provide the
signatures above:

* a function `get_transcript_size` that, given a
  student's internal ID, returns the number of entries in the
  student's grade transcript.
* a function `load_transcript` that loads the grades in
  a student's transcript from a database into a preallocated array
  `grades` of the appropriate size.
* a function `read_int` that asks the user to input
  an integer number into the system.

The system is supposed to never reveal the internal ID of the student
whose grades are queried by the user (here 42). However, the code has
a potential security problem. That is, a malicious user could
manipulate the system into revealing the internal ID of the student
via the print statement in function `main` by entering appropriate
`int` values into the system via the function `read_int`.

Use your knowledge about how the compiler-generated calling sequences
manage actual parameters and local variables of functions on the stack
to explain the problem. Assume that the functions
`get_transcript_size`, `load_transcript`, and `read_int` are all
implemented correctly. 


**Hint:** you do not have to provide the actual value that the
attacker needs to enter in order to retrieve the student ID as it will
be compiler/architecture specific and may not always succeed. Instead,
explain the general idea of the exploit. Note that the attacker is
**not allowed to change the program**. The only way they can interact
with the system is by entering integer values via the function
`read_int`. That said, you can use the dummy implementation given in
`problem1.c` to experiment with the problem.

Note that the grades are represented as characters. If the attacker
succeeds in retrieving the student ID it will be printed as an ASCII
character. The actual ID is obtained by converting the ASCII
character(s) to their ASCII code(s).

You should assume C semantics for array accesses. That is, an array
`a` of type `char[]` is a pointer to the memory location of the first
entry of the array. An array read `a[i]` then reads the memory
location at address `a + i`.

### Problem 2: Deep vs. Shallow Binding (6 Points)

Consider the following Scala program:

```scala
var x = 0

def set_x(v: Int): Unit =
  x = v


def foo(s: Int => Unit, y: Int): () => Unit = 
  var x = 0
  
  def print_x(): Unit = println(x)

  s(y)
  print_x()
  print_x


val p = foo(set_x, 1)
set_x(2)
p()
```

1. What does this program print with static scoping and deep binding
   semantics (i.e. Scala's standard semantics)?  Explain.
   
2. What would this program print if Scala were to use dynamic scoping
   and shallow binding semantics? Explain.

### Problem 3: Parameter Passing Modes (8 Points)

Consider the following program:

```scala
def params(x: Int, y: Int): Unit =
  x = y + y
  println(x)

var z = 1
params(z, {z = z + 1; z})
println(z)
```

What does this program print if we make the following assumptions about
the parameter passing modes for the parameters `x` and `y` of
`params`:

1. both `x` and `y` are call-by-value parameters;
2.  `x` is call-by-reference and `y` is call-by-value;
3. `x` is call-by-value and `y` is call-by-name;
4. `x` is call-by-reference and `y` is call-by-name;

It is enough if you provide the outputs of the two `println` calls for
each variant. You don't need to explain your results.

Clarifications: 

* While the code looks like Scala code, Scala does not actually allow
  assignments to parameters and does not support parameters with
  call-by-reference semantics directly. So you can't execute the above
  code in Scala as given. We here consider a hypothetical language
  that behaves like Scala in every way except for the above
  differences. In particular:
  
* We are using static scoping and a value-based memory model. So a
  variable in the code is interpreted as either an l-value or r-value
  depending on context.

* The arguments passed to parameters with passing modes that follow a
  strict evaluation strategy are evaluated in left-to-right order at
  the call site.

* The expression `{z = z + 1; z}` first increments `z` and then returns the new value of `z`.

### Problem 4: Implementing Custom Control-Flow Constructs (2 Points)

Call-by-name parameters are particularly useful when one wants to
implement custom control-flow constructs. Here, we use this idea to
extend Scala with a new loop construct

```scala
until (cond) { 
  body
}
```

This loop construct should behave like a `while` loop in Scala, except
that the loop condition is negated: the loop exits when `cond` becomes
`true` rather than `false`. That is, the above code should behave
exactly like the following while loop:

```scala
while (!cond) {
  body
}
```

We can implement `until` as a function that takes the loop condition
`cond` and the loop body `body` as call-by-name parameters:

```scala
def until(cond: => Boolean)(body: => Unit): Unit = {
  ???
}
```

Note that we here take advantage of another useful feature of Scala:
multiple parameter lists. The two parameters `cond` and `body` are
passed to `until` in separate parameter lists. This allows us to call
`until` as if it were a loop construct that was built into the Scala
language. For instance, with the correct implementation of `until`,
the following code will print all values from `1` to `10`:

```scala
var x = 0

until (x == 10) {
  x = x + 1
  println(x)
}
```

Here, the expression `x == 10` will be passed to `cond` and the block
expression `{ x = x + 1; println(x) }` will be passed to `body`.

Provide an implementation of `until` that has the desired behavior.
Do not use a while loop for the implementation of `until`. Instead,
use recursion to implement the looping behavior.
